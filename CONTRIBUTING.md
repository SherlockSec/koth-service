# Contributing Guidelines

## Requirements

 - Working in a KoTH box environment
 - Commented code (Golang can be messy, as long as I can understand the code enough to know what it does / changes, you should be good)

Once these requirements are met, I'll test it using the TryHackMe backend. If it passes said tests, I merge and add you to the credits.  

Please try and keep the general structure of the code, and explain what the changes do in your Pull Request.
